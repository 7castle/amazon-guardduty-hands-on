## Getting Started with Amazon GuardDuty

This GitHub repository walks you through a scenario covering threat detection and remediation using Amazon GuardDuty. The scenario covers an attack that simulates a few threat vectors. This represents just a small sample of the threats that GuardDuty is able to detect. In addition, we look at how to view the GuardDuty findings, how to alert based on the findings and finally how to remediate findings. The CloudFormation template builds out the assets used to simulate the attacks and instructions are provided on how to analyze and remediate the attacks.
